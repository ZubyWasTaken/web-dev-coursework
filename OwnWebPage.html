	<p>George Square is the principal civic square in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. Named after King George III, George
		Square was laid out in 1781, part of the innovative Georgian central grid plan that initially spanned from
		Stockwell Street east to Buchanan Street.
		The east side of the square is dominated by the ornate Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City
		Council, which opened in 1888. On the South side are a number of buildings, including the former General Post
		Office, built in 1878 and currently under redevelopment.

		The Clyde Arc (known locally as the Squinty Bridge), is a road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, in
		west central Scotland, connecting Finnieston, near the Clyde Auditorium and SECC with Pacific Quay and Glasgow
		Science Centre in Govan. A prominent feature of the bridge is its innovative curved design and the way that it
		crosses the river at an angle. The Arc is the first city centre traffic crossing over the river built since the
		Kingston Bridge was opened to traffic in 1969.
		The bridge connects Finnieston Street on the north bank of the river to Govan Road on the southern bank. The
		bridge takes four lanes of traffic, two of which are dedicated to public transport and two for private and
		commercial traffic. There are also pedestrian and cycle paths. The new bridge was built to provide better access
		to Pacific Quay and allow better access to regeneration areas on both banks of the Clyde. The bridge has been
		designed to cope with a possible light rapid transit system (light railway scheme) or even a tram system.
