        <h4>Voiced by Steve Carell</h4>

        <p>
            Felonius Gru is the main character of Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, and Despicable Me 3, alongside Mel and
            a minor character in Minions. He is often referred to by his surname Gru, was formerly a supervillain and
            jelly manufacturer and a consultant for the Anti-Villain League.
        </p>
        <p>
            Born from the family with long line of villainy and formerly the world's greatest villain, Gru has been
            ousted by Vector, who had stolen the Pyramid of Giza and been bestowed the honor of pulling off the "crime
            of
            the century". In response, Gru unveils his plan for an even more impressive crime; the theft of the Moon.
            When
            his plans are interrupted by Vector, Gru becomes the adoptive father of three girls: Margo, Edith, and
            Agnes.

            the reunion with his brother and his family, Dru looks forward to learn some skills of being a villain from
            him,

            mansion and Dru's villain wheels.

            mother, Marlena. But unlike Gru, who is bald, he has a full head of blonde shaggy hair, inherited from his
            father, and wears a white suit, scarf and shoes, as opposed to Gru. His eyes are blue, and he is
            left-handed.
