    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <h3>Gru</h3>
    <div class="info">
        <p>
            Felonius Gru is the main character of Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, and Despicable Me 3, alongside Mel and
            a
            <br />
            minor character in Minions. He is often referred to by his surname Gru, was formerly a supervillain and
            jelly<br />
            manufacturer and a consultant for the Anti-Villain League.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Born from the family with long line of villainy and formerly the world's greatest villain, Gru has been
            ousted<br />
            by Vector, who had stolen the Pyramid of Giza and been bestowed the honor of pulling off the "crime of
            the<br />
            century". In response, Gru unveils his plan for an even more impressive crime; the theft of the Moon. When
            his<br />
            plans are interrupted by Vector, Gru becomes the adoptive father of three girls: Margo, Edith, and Agnes.

    <h3>Dru</h3>
    <div class="info">
        <p>
            Dru Gru is one of the main characters in Despicable Me 3, the twin brother of Felonius Gru and son of Robert
            and
            <br />
            Marlena Gru, Lucy Wilde's brother-in-law, and the adoptive paternal uncle of Margo, Edith, and Agnes. After
            the
            <br />
            reunion with his brother and his family, Dru looks forward to learn some skills of being a villain from him,
            <br />
            though Gru had been an Anti-Villain League agent and quit villany for a while. Dru is also owner of Dru's
            <br />
            mansion and Dru's villain wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to his identical twin brother, Dru has a unique appearance with a long pointed nose just like his
            <br />
            mother, Marlena. But unlike Gru, who is bald, he has a full head of blonde shaggy hair, inherited from his
            <br />
            father, and wears a white suit, scarf and shoes, as opposed to Gru. His eyes are blue, and he is
            left-handed.
