            "Predictable but fun, this "threequel" is an amusing, kid-friendly mix of sibling interaction, <br />
            '80s humor, and
            irresistibly silly minion jokes."

            "The third Despicable Me film chronologically is also the third-best in terms of quality. But it has just
            enough energy and flashes of inspiration to suggest it’s a franchise that could run and run."

            "The third installment, is precisely as fast paced, zany, ridiculous and often hilarious as the first two.
            If you’re in the mood for harmless entertainment you can’t go wrong with this one."

            "Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig revisit their familiar characters in Despicable Me 3, but this sequel shows
            signs of wear even as the energy level escalates."

            "For reasons not worth getting into, Gru’s Minions somehow wind up in prison, providing a cutesy narrative
            that is virtually its own short film, having nothing to do with the rest of the movie."
